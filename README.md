A React frontend for a Shopping App portfolio project

TODO: Base functionality
- When all boxes are ticked, app can be added to portfolio
- [x] Get base working (API contact, webpage shown)
- [x] Have Carousel work and base styling
    - [x] Set 10 random products to be shown on carousel
- [ ] Set dynamic results on home page when changing results size
- [ ] Change shown products when limited on results by changing "pages"
- [ ] Have product page become dynamically created when selected
    - DevNote: This can be done by leveraging SKU GET request in API
- [ ] Create POST request usage to add product
- [ ] Create UPDATE request for changing product
- [ ] Decent CSS styling to look somewhat nice (I don't have an eye for this so don't expect much)
- [ ] Host both front and back ends on cloud service to be publicly accessible
